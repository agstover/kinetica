Refrigeration is quite simple in concept but can become quite complex in its execution. So, let’s start with the simple. Virtually all mechanical refrigeration systems operate according to the same basic principle: a liquid called a refrigerant is pumped through a system that absorbs heat from inside of a space and then dumps heat outside of the space. You can think about it like sitting in a boat with a hole in the bottom and emptying it out with a sponge. Heat is gathered up a little bit at a time and “tossed overboard”.

To increase the ability of the refrigerant to absorb and reject heat, throughout the process the refrigerant is pressurized and depressurized and transformed from a liquid to a gas and back again.

Turning the refrigerant into a gas allows the pressurization and depressurization. Pressurizing and depressurizing is important because it forces the liquid to become much hotter and colder respectively. The greater the difference in temperature between the refrigerant and the inside and outside temperature, the more effectively the refrigerant will be able to absorb and dump heat.  
  
This process involves four components:

1. A device to increase refrigerant pressure
2. A device to dump heat from the refrigerant
3. A device to decrease refrigerant pressure
4. A device to absorb heat into the refrigerant

Respectively, these devices are called:

1. Compressor
2. Condenser
3. Expansion valve
4. Evaporator

Let's look at each in detail.
