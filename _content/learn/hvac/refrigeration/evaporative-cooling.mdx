A surprise treat for you! If you’ve already read the section regarding the physics of thermal energy to the end. You’re already pretty familiar with the most basic kind of refrigeration system!

Because water takes so much energy to phase change into a gas (the more scientific way of describing this would be to say that water has a high Latent Heat of Vaporization), we can use this latent heat as a place to “store away” a lot of energy that won’t affect the temperature of the water vapor.  
  
If we pass air over a wet surface, the water will absorb large amounts of energy from the air. This changes the sensible energy of the air, dropping its temperature, into the energy required to break the bonds in the water. Water molecules with increased energy then evaporate and get carried away with air that is now much cooler than before.You can test this yourself by wetting a towel down and standing outside. The water effectively acts as a refrigerant, that is a substance that is used to pump heat energy around by absorbing heat from one place and taking it somewhere else.

A more industrial use of this phenomenon is the “Evaporative Cooler”, more colloquially known as the “Swamp Cooler”. The swap cooler has a large filter which soaks up water from a basin, and then a fan pulls air from outside, passing it through the filter where the water takes energy from the air, cools it, and then gets pulled into whatever space is being cooled. These sorts of set ups can be very effective in hot dry climates. However in hot, humid climates, where the vapor pressure is higher and the water vapor pressure is much closer to equilibrium with liquid water, these systems will not work well because the air isn’t capable of accepting a lot of new water molecules.   
  
In order to provide cooling for more demanding scenarios, like the wet, humid South or the inside of your refrigerator which must be quite a bit cooler, we need to turn to more involved mechanical processes to pump heat out of the air.

Hot air passes across a wet surface. Kinetic energy is absorbed by water molecules which causes them to evaporate. This transfer of energy from the air to the water molecules cools the air.
