The purpose of the compressor is to take a vapor that has a low volume (molecules are spread out) and push all of the molecules together. Doing so increases the temperature of the vapor because the act of pushing on molecules transfers energy to them, kind of like hitting a baseball with a bat.

In order to do this, the compressor will take in the vapor and move it into a smaller and smaller container. This decrease in the volume of the space which holds the vapor molecules pushes the molecules closer together meaning they hit the walls more frequently thereby increasing the pressure they exert on their container.

This can be done in a variety of different ways. Two of the most common are scroll compressors, which are usually used in smaller devices, and screw compressors, which are used in larger, more industrial applications.  
  
A scroll compressor uses two spiraling pieces of metal set within one another. One of the spirals is stationary while the other one moves around in a circle. Vapor is trapped in sections of the spiral where contact is not made with the walls and gradually moved towards the middle of the spiral. As it moves towards the middle of the spiral, the space of the pocket gets smaller and smaller, which increases the pressure of the vapor. Eventually, when the gas reaches the center of the spiral, it’s pushed out of the compressor at a much higher temperature and pressure.

A screw compressor works in a very similar fashion, except instead of spirals, two large interconnected screws are used. As the screws turn, they pull air down a channel that gets smaller and smaller.

Heating and pressurizing vapor are not the only functions this component serves. It’s also responsible for pulling the refrigerant through the entire system. Gasses move from high pressure to low pressure in their attempt to achieve an equilibrium. By increasing the pressure on one side, it creates a pressure gradient which ensures that vapor will be “sucked” back towards the compressor.
