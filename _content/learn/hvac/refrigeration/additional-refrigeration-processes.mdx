# Receiver

A receiver is a device that is placed very close to the outlet of the condenser, and its function is to store excessive liquid refrigerant that my build up in the condenser or as a place for the refrigerant to go when the whole system is undergoing maintenance.   
  
An important part of maintaining a refrigeration system is making sure that all of the components of the system have the appropriate refrigerant pressure for the workload that the system is up against. Some systems, in order to maintain an appropriate amount of pressure in the condenser, allow the condenser to build up liquid refrigerant and “flood” which reduces its effectiveness. This is useful if the temperature difference between the hot condenser gas and the outside air increases, an event which would cause increased condensation and increased pressure. By flooding parts of the condenser, you effectively shut them off, and can maintain a uniform pressure and heat dumping capacity.

# Suction Accumulator

Compressors and liquids do not mix. Liquid, because its molecules are so close together, is highly incompressible. That means if a lot of liquid gets into the compressor it can cause all kinds of havoc. The liquid can ping around in the compressor causing damage. Another issue that can arise stems from how compressors are lubricated. Small amounts of oil are circulated throughout the refrigeration system which lubricates the compressor. This oil does not mix very well with refrigerant gas, and will fall out of the gas and be pushed along through the system by the flow of the gas. However, the oil readily mixes with liquid refrigerant, and if this liquid mixture gets into the compressor and encounters a low pressure scenario in the compressing process, such as when the compressor starts up, the refrigerant will flash into gas creating an oil “foam” which can leak out of the compressor. Over time, this removes oil from the system reducing the efficiency of the compressor.

One way to combat this is to use a suction accumulator which is similar to the receiver in that it acts as a reservoir for liquid refrigerant that has not fully evaporated in the evaporator and has made its way to the condenser. This device will slowly meter the collected liquid refrigerant back out into the suction line in amounts that are sure to vaporize into gas before they hit the compressor.

# Filter Dryer

Liquid refrigerant isn’t the only substance that can find its way into the compressor. Over time, water can also work its way into the refrigeration line. Not only that, small fragments of metal, dirt and chips can find their way into the lines. These substances will, over time, ruin not only the compressor, but all the other parts of the system as well.

To combat this, a filter dryer is used. The filter drier can be placed before the compressor on the suction line, or before the evaporator on the liquid line. This device can use a variety of different substances to filter out unwanted substances such as a solid porous material with aluminum to filter out acids, a reservoir of descants to filter out moisture, or a polyester screen with very tiny holes to catch dirt particles.

# Solenoid Valve

A solenoid is a piston that is controlled by an electromagnet. That sounds complicated but really you can just think of it as a valve that is controlled by electricity. Electricity is sent to it, the piston drives down and blocks the flow of refrigerant. When electricity flow is removed a spring pushes the piston back up. This effect can also be reversed so that electricity actually causes the valve to open and its absence causes the valve to close.

This device is basically useful for shutting off the flow of refrigerant in the system in order to allow the compressor to basically empty all of the refrigerant into the condenser or the receiver.

# Hot Gas Bypass Valve

Much in the same way that flooding the condenser can regulate the effectiveness and pressure in the condenser when the difference between the condenser and the outside temperature changes, the hot gas bypass valve helps adjust the pressure and efficiency of the evaporator.  
  
To do this, a line goes directly from the outlet of the compressor, which has high pressure, hot gas, to the evaporator. Doing this increases the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant in the evaporator. In the middle of the line, there is a valve which controls whether or not or how much hot gas is injected into the evaporator.

# Oil Separator

On smaller refrigeration systems, the oil which lubricates the compressor is simply mixed with the refrigerant. When this mixture turns to gas in the evaporator, the oil separates out and flows along to the compressor where it is used for lubrication. On larger systems and systems which must achieve colder temperatures, though, it can be difficult for the oil to return from the evaporator, so a device is used to filter out the oil from the refrigerant. This device is placed directly after the compressor. The oil refrigerant mixture passes through it, the oil is collected, stored in a reservoir and reintroduced to the compressor as needed.
