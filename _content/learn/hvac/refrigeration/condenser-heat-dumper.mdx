The condenser is a relatively simple piece of equipment which essentially consists of a long twisting tube connected to an array of metal fins. Refrigerant in the form of very hot, high pressure gas flows into the top of the tube. The kinetic energy of the refrigerant molecules hits the sides of the tube as the refrigerant moves through, transfering energy to the metal. This sort of heat transfer, where energy is transmitted through contact between two objects is called conduction. Therefore, you can think of the tube as a sort of thermal extension of the refrigerant. This is why the metal fins are so important; they dramatically increase the surface area between the coolant and the air passing by. One or multiple fans will blow air across the metal fins to accelerate the transfer of heat from the refrigerant to the outside.

As the refrigerant moves through the condenser, it will dump energy into the surrounding air, and by the time it gets to the bottom of the twisting tube, it will have lost so much energy that it will have undergone phase change and turned into a liquid where it is passed onto the next component in the system by the **liquid line**.

One interesting thing to realize here is that because a phase change takes place, much of the energy that is dumped here is latent heat. That means the refrigerant gives away a lot of energy without changing temperature. Because thermal transfer requires a difference in temperature (remember substances that touch seek thermal equilibrium), and because a larger difference in temperature between two bodies increases the rate of the transfer of thermal energy between them, the fact that the refrigerant is dumping latent heat makes this process very efficient. In effect, the temperature of the refrigerant is “pegged” at the temperature of the phase change, but it’s still dumping heat. That means the difference in temperature between the two substances is only changing on one side. Imagine if both substances were transfering sensible heat. The temperature of both would move towards one another, the temperature difference would get smaller faster, and the rate would slow.
