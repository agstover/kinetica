title: The Evaporator (Heat Absorber)
slug: evaporator

This element of the refrigeration cycle is where the heat from the outside environment gets absorbed and taken away. After the refrigerant leaves the expansion valve, it’s partially a liquid, partially a gas and quite a bit colder than the air temperature in the space which you’re trying to cool. This refrigerant mixture, much like the condenser, will run up a long winding tube which is connected to metal fins. However, unlike the condenser, the liquid in the tubes is quite cold, and any air moving across the fins will give away its energy to the fins and be taken up by the refrigerant. A fan or blower will be directed at the coils in order to move more air across them.

As the refrigerant absorbs energy from its environment, the temperature of the refrigerant will rise until it reaches the boiling point of the refrigerant. At this point the refrigerant will begin to phase change into a gas. You can imagine the coils of the evaporator as three different sections. In the bottom section all of the refrigerant will be liquid. In the middle section, the refrigerant will be a mixture of refrigerant and refrigerant vapor. At the top of the evaporator, the refrigerant will be entirely gas. This gas is then transported away from the evaporator to the condenser where the entire refrigeration process repeats.
