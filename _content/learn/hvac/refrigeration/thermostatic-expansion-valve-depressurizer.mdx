title: Thermostatic Expansion Valve (Depressurizer)

The thermostatic expansion valve, hereafter referred to as the TXV, receives the medium temperature, high pressure liquid produced by the condenser. Inside of the TXV is a small hole with a pin blocking the hole. The pin blocking this hole is in contact with another pin from above which will push down on the bottom pin, opening up the hole based on the temperature that is coming out of the evaporator (the next device we’ll be discussing). In doing this the TXV is able to control just how much refrigerant it lets through.

Because that pinhole valve is able to limit how much liquid comes through, the small amounts of liquid emerge to find themselves in a large volume of space compared to the small amount of liquid. Because the intermolecular forces between the molecules of refrigerant are so weak, being in a low pressure environment allows them to break away from one another. This causes a small part of the liquid to rapidly change into a gas, also known as “flash gas”.

Because we know that changing phases from a liquid to a gas requires a lot of energy to break the bonds into a molecule, we know that this expansion process will need energy to occur. Where does this energy come from? When the liquid refrigerant leaves the expansion valve, the faster moving molecules will begin to break away from the rest, flashing into gas. The energy they use to do this comes from the internal energy of the liquid. This means that the phase change uses the latent energy in the liquid, and then begins to rob the liquid of its kinetic energy. A drop in kinetic energy across the system causes a drop in temperature. This means that the total energy of the refrigerant doesn’t really change. Effectively the sensible heat of the refrigerant is converted into latent heat.

Some liquid still remains after this process, and this mixture of liquid and vapor flows off to the evaporator for further processing. The TXV is also called a metering valve because part of its job is to make sure the evaporator has enough liquid refrigerant to be able to do its job. It “meters” the flow of refrigerant to the evaporator.
