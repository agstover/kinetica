title: Air Pressure

We know that in general it’s safe to think about changing temperature in terms of the movement of and contact between molecules. In other words, temperature is the average amount of kinetic energy of all of the molecules in a system. 

We also know that molecules, depending on their levels of energy, can arrange themselves in certain ways; most importantly, based on the strength of the attraction between molecules they can organize themselves into solids, or be disorganized into liquids and gasses.

Our everyday experience of water, for instance, tells us that water freezes at 32°F and boils to a steam at 212°F.

Is this always the case, though? The answer is no. These are not some magical universal temperatures. In fact, water only undergoes phase change at these temperatures at sea level. Weird!
The reason behind this is that there is another variable which interacts with the molecules of a substance, and that is the molecules of the air around it. 

Because we know that temperature is only the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a system, we can also deduce that the individual molecules are actually moving at different speeds. In any given substance, there are molecules that have more kinetic energy and molecules that have less. That means that molecules at the surface of the water, which have slightly more energy have the ability to break their bonds to the molecules around them and “jump” into the air. This is evaporation. 

These molecules mix into the air (diffuse). At the same time, these molecules can also bang around against molecules in the air and be sent back to the surface of the substance where they’re reclaimed by the liquid. This is called condensation.


If the system is open, imagine a cup of water sitting on a table, many of the molecules which have evaporated will be carried away by moving air molecules never to return to the substance. This is why a cup of water will eventually evaporate away to nothing, and why blowing a fan across its surface will increase the rate of evaporation. Water molecules are much less likely to return to it. 

Imagine you stuck a big rubber cork in the top of the glass, though, and closed the system. Molecule prison! No molecules are getting in or out. Water molecules will begin to evaporate from the surface of the water which increases the number of molecules in the air. The molecules in the air are all bumping against one another and the inside of the container, and due to the increased number of molecules in the air as the water evaporates, the pressure of the air increases; kind of like shoving more people onto a crowded bus. This in turn pushes more of the water molecules down into the water, lowering the pressure, and the process repeats.

Eventually, the rate at which particles leave the water and enter the water will be the same, and there will be a constant number of water molecules in the air. This concentration of water molecules is known as the vapor pressure. This pressure is in addition to the pressure exerted by the existing air within the vessel, known as the atmospheric pressure.

Remember, though, the vapor pressure is affected by the rate of this cycle, which means if we add more kinetic energy to the water by heating it, the rate of evaporation will increase, molecules will evaporate more quickly, and the vapor pressure will be higher.
At a certain point, if you keep heating the water, the molecules will evaporate so fast that the vapor pressure will equal the pressure of the air in the vessel. This means that the air pressure that is pushing down on the water molecules is no longer high enough to hold them close to one another, and the fast moving molecules begin to spread out and vaporize. This is what boiling is!

Since boiling is the relationship between the energy in the water molecules and the pressure of the air around them that hold them in a liquid form, lowering the pressure of the air around the water means boiling can take place at a lower temperature! In fact, with a low enough pressure, say using a pressure chamber, you could boil water at room temperature.

So why does this matter in HVAC. Well, remember that when molecules of a liquid substance gain enough energy to jump into a gas, they take that energy with them. This means that as something boils or evaporates, the liquid actually loses heat!

This is how evaporative cooling works. High energy water molecules peace out and take the energy away from the water which gives you a nice heat sink with which you can pull heat from a space. Knowing that air pressure affects the temperature at which the process occurs gives HVAC systems a neat tool to use for sucking the energy out of a system in a manageable, controlled manner.
