**Heat is energy**

In order to better understand how the temperature of an object changes, I want you to forget, for a while, that temperature is a thing. Instead, all we’re going to think about is energy. What is energy? To stay out of the weeds of advanced physics we can think about energy simply as the movement of molecules. When something is “hot” it simply means that molecules are moving really fast. When something is “cold” it means the molecules are moving slowly. In fact, “hot” and “cold” don’t really give you that much information because it’s all relative. You may think your pizza is hot, but it’s _way colder_ than the sun and _way hotter_ than the surface of Neptune.   
  
Instead of thinking about hot and cold, for now just think about a bunch of molecules all shaking around in a group, hereafter referred to as a system of molecules.   
  
All of the molecules of a system are shaking around at every so slightly different speeds, but if you were to look at a system of molecules and say: “I wonder what the average amount of movement is between all of these molecules”, you would essentially be asking: “What’s the temperature of this system?”

That’s what temperature is; not how the system feels to the touch or whether it’s liquid, solid or gas. The temperature of a system is simply the **average internal kinetic energy** of all the molecules of that system.   
  
So what happens if you put two systems next to one another; for example, you might set an ice cube (system) on your hand (system). At the place where the two contact, the molecules from each system interact. The molecules in your hand are moving faster (high energy!) and “bump” into the molecules in the ice cube, speeding them up. This transfer of kinetic energy from a high energy system into a low energy system is called heating.

Over time, the molecules of the low energy system will continue to bleed away kinetic energy from the high energy system until the molecules of both systems achieve the same internal kinetic energy. This is called **thermal equilibrium**, because the kinetic energy of the molecules have all become _equal_.

This is the trick that is used to “heat” and “cool” a space in HVAC. If you want to cool a space, you have to take something with slow moving molecules, put it in contact with the air from a space and steal some of the kinetic energy away from the molecules in the air. Conversely, if you want to heat a space, you have to transfer kinetic energy into the air molecules in the space.

**Phase Change**

So now we understand that temperature is basically just the average of how much all the molecules in a system are vibrating and moving (their average kinetic energy). Following from that, we could guess that the more you pump energy into a system, the higher the temperature of the system will get. This is true! To a point.  
  
You see, all of these molecules carry an electric charge, and imbalances in the electric charge cause one side of the molecule to become more positively charged and the other side to become more negatively charged. You can kind of think of molecules like little magnets; the negative end will attract the positive end of other molecules causing them to stick together.

In a solid, the molecules are vibrating very little, and so it is very easy for all of the molecules to grab onto one another and stay in place.

In a liquid, the molecules are vibrating and moving around so much that the molecules can’t get a firm hold on one another. As the molecules fly around in the liquid they’re able to briefly grab hold of one another, but very quickly the energy in their motion carries them off. This is why a liquid is able to move around and take the shape of the container its in, but doesn’t expand to fill the container; the molecules hangout together, but aren’t locked to a neighbor indefinitely.

In a gas, the molecules have so much energy and movement that they’re no longer able to stay connected to one another in any fashion, which means they’ll zoom around and evenly fill whatever container they’re in. This is how a liquid transitions into a gas. Molecules near the surface gain enough momentum that they can’t hang onto their neighbors any longer and go shooting off into the environment.

NOTE HERE ABOUT HOW SWEAT WORKS

In order to go from a solid to a liquid (**melting**), a liquid to a gas (**evaporation**), or a solid to a gas (**sublimation**) you have to add more kinetic energy to the molecules in the system (heat it).  
  
In order to go from a gas to a liquid (**condensation**), a liquid to a solid (**freezing**), or a gas to a solid (**deposition**), you have to remove kinetic energy from the molecules in the system (cool it).  
  
These different arrangements of molecules (solid, liquid and gas) are known as **phases**, and while the temperature (the average kinetic energy of all the molecules in a system) will change as you heat or cool the system, at the point where the molecules undergo a change in phase (a **phase change**), the temperature will stop changing until the phase change is complete.  
  
Weird, huh?

The bonds between molecules take energy to release and in order to form, energy needs to be removed from the movement of molecules so the attraction between them is stronger than their movement. During this process of releasing or forming bonds, all of the energy added to or removed from the system goes towards these ends.

So, if you decide you want to heat a solid until it’s a liquid, you’ll add energy to it, the temperature will rise, and there will come a point when the molecules can’t move around any more without breaking their bonds. At this point all of the energy you pump into the system is, in a sense, diverted to breaking bonds instead of moving molecules. Once all of the static bonds that held the molecules in place in the solid have been broken, the energy will go back towards vibrating and moving the molecules and the temperature will rise.

Likewise, if you were to reverse this process and try to turn the liquid back into a solid, you would remove energy from the system, the temperature would drop, and there will come a temperature at which if the molecules slow down any more, they’ll start to be able to grab on to one another in a very permanent way. All of the extra energy you remove from the system until all of the molecules are locked into a solid will be used to form those bonds between molecules.

This extra energy you add or remove from a system during phase change which doesn’t result in a change in temperature is called **latent heat**, and can be thought of as a sort of “energy tax” in the mission to raise and lower the temperature of systems of molecules. 

**Why latent heat matters to HVAC**

Water is a special little substance. Remember when we talked about how the shape of molecules is lumpy which causes them to have positive and negative sides? Well water is quite a bit lumpier than most. H20 molecules form a “dipole” arrangement which causes them to have very strong positive and negative sides which, in turn means the bonds between H20 molecules are very strong, which in turn means that it takes a lot of energy to break them.   
  
As an example of the opposite, the air we breathe is made up of 78% nitrogen. A molecule of nitrogen is very symmetrical, and so the variations in positive and negative charge that cause the molecules to bind to one another are simply caused by slight wobbles in the shape of the electron cloud around the molecule. This means that their ability to grab onto other nitrogen molecules is extremely weak, which in turn explains why the boiling point of nitrogen is -297.3°F! It takes _very little energy_ to turn the molecules in the air we breathe into their gaseous state, that is, all of the molecules in the air except for water.

All gasses contain latent heat, which as we know, is the extra heat we had to pump into the earlier phase which _does not register on the thermometer_. This means that all gasses are carrying around a little something extra in terms of energy. When compared with the other gases in the air that surround us, gaseous water carries around _a lot of something extra_. This extra heat contained within the water vapor which is not registered by thermometer is the reason why humid climates feel way hotter than the outside temperature and why people in Arizona claim the temperature isn’t bad because it’s a “dry heat”. The less water in the air, the less extra water vapor latent energy you’re subjected to.

This means that HVAC technicians have to take extra steps beyond just using air temperature and thermometers to figure out how to heat and cool spaces. If they don’t find ways to accurately identify and account for this secret heat water vapor is carrying around, they won’t be able to effectively make people comfortable!
