title: What is HVAC?
slug: summary

---
First, let’s get the acronym out of the way. HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. The absolute simplest way of thinking about HVAC is looking at it as an arrangement of devices that work together to achieve one basic goal: make the air in a certain place *just right* in terms of temperature, humidity and air quality. Simple enough right?

On top of this simple goal of achieving air that’s “just right” are layers of complexity we’ll slowly peel away as you move through this course.   
  
What might some of those complexities be?

Well first of all, it’s easy enough to say that we’re going to “change the temperature of the air”, but how do you even do that?! A blowtorch? A bucket of ice? Technically, yes. Those would change the temperature of the air around them, but there are much more efficient ways of doing this, and to really understand them we’ll need to understand a bit of the physics of how energy moves between different substances. Once you understand this, you’ll start to see that HVAC is a bit like being an energy cowboy, wrangling energy from or to a target with physics as your lasso!

Temperature isn’t the only thing we care about, though. There are other characteristics of air that are important to manage. For example, humidity (which relates to temperature as we’ll learn later). Too much and you can get mold or and if it’s hot out, the heat will be exacerbated. Too little and you’ll need to break out the chapstick.

Another consideration is the little trash and bugs that are hanging out in the air itself. Pollution is no joke, as it can cause sickness, disease or even death.

Once we understand the fundamental forces of the universe that allow you to manage these factors, we’ll look into the machines that allow you to control them and how they work. We’ll look at their different pieces individually, and then slowly pull out and explore how they’re installed and serviced and how multiple devices are integrated together to produce complete HVAC systems.
